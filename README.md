I post solutions to the questions I've come across in Google Foobar. Special thanks to @smaranjitghose bhaiya for taking the time to help me out with different problems! The syntax used is of Python 2.7.

## Overview 
Problems are distributed across five levels of difficulty. The number of questions you need to solve per level is as follows:
- Level 1: 1 Question
- Level 2: 2 Questions
- Level 3: 3 Questions
- Level 4: 2 Questions
- Levl 5: 1 Question

## Language
You are exempted to use Python or Java to solve these time-bound questions. I have used Python.
